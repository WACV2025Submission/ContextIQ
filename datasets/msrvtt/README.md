## MSR-VTT
---

MSR-VTT is used as one of the datasets to benchmark ContextIQ and compare with other methods, as mentioned in sec. 4.3 of the paper **ContextIQ: A Multimodal Expert-Based Video Retrieval System for Contextual Advertising**.

* The `1KA` validation split is used. The video ids are present in [val_list_jsfusion.txt](val_list_jsfusion.txt).
* One caption is randomly sampled for each of the video clips, which formed the query set. The sampled sentence ids are present in [sen_id_sample.txt](sen_id_sample.txt).
